# simple javaScript pokedex

## a WIP pokedex project used to learn & practice javascript

This project is a WIP that I'm using to learn & practice JavaScript. This is my first JavaScript project! This code shows how to:

* implement bootstrap
* integrate an API
* implement bootstrap elements (modals, buttons, navbar)
* use code linters like eslinter 


## This project:

* depends on bootstrap
* depends on jQuery
* uses standard eslint rules
* uses the [pokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
